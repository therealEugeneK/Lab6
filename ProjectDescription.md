This program reads in a CSV file that contains data of the top played singles of the week and the artists who wrote the respective songs. This data is then processed and the program outputs data to a seperate file that shows how many times an artist was feautured in the original list. A sanner is used to scan the original CSV file and then the information is stored in a string array. To make sure that there are no duplicates saved in the array, a searching method is employed. Once the data is filtered through, it is printed in the output file.
